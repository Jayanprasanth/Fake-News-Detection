# üí≥ Fake News Detection using NLP techniques

Fake News Detection using NLP techniques involves applying natural language processing methods such as text preprocessing, tokenization, and vectorization to analyze and classify news articles as real or fake. By leveraging machine learning algorithms like Logistic Regression or Random Forest, NLP can identify misleading or false content by examining patterns in language and context.

## üìå Problem Statement

With the rapid rise of online media, the spread of fake news has become a critical challenge, affecting public opinion and societal well-being. Detecting fake news is complex due to the subtle differences between real and fabricated information. By leveraging Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques and machine learning algorithms, we aim to develop an efficient system that can accurately classify news as real or fake, helping mitigate the negative impacts of misinformation.
